# MadMapper-x-Teensy-4.0-x-USB-LED-Pixel-Mapping
Here is the code to enable MadMapper to communicate with a Teensy 4.0 and directly map onto 5v WS2812 LED strips.

This way you can easily light up LEDs from a computer without too much setup.

This can do much longer lengths of LED strips. Much longer and you will need a larger power supply as the USB cable from a computer can only supply so much.
